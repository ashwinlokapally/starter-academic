I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Sive lab at the Whitehead Institue - MIT. I'm working on neural crest cell migration, brain & craniofacial development and deveopmental disorders associated with it. The work also encompasses the role of extreme anterior domain in brain and craniofacial structure formation. 

During my PhD, I charactered the functional role of TRIM E3 ligases during early neurogenesis. I developed a yeast 2 hydrid screen using Xenopus embryo library and also the LC-MS/MS proteomic screening method to identify the functional interaction partners of Trim2 E3 ligase. I could show that Trim2 interacts with ALIX/ESCRT complex and plays a key role in the determination and differentiation of neural progenitors via the modulation of proliferation/apoptosis during neurogenesis (Lokapally et al., Cells 2020).

I also have a keen interest in the use of machine learning and artifitial intelligence to create intelligent algorithms for healthcare applications. Aside from research, at MIT I was the Co-chair of Community Building of the Postdoctoral Association, working to create a communal environment and professional growth of postdocs. I'm also a member of the Whitehead Postdoctoral Association.
